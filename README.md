# Short Group Project for CS445 Spring 2019
Group members consist of Jaden Drury and Chris Wilson.

Our main implementation goal is to allow users to use "filters" when searching in the DOMA database. This will allow them to search by subject, instead of specifically title-based searches. This should result in more useful searches and make searching for particular artifact records easier.



This repository contains code for a running example in 
[the Spring 2019 section of CS445 Human-Computer Interaction](http://www.cs.bsu.edu/~pvgestwicki/courses/cs445Sp19/)
at [Ball State University](https://www.bsu.edu).

This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/). If you clone it into [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), 
you will be able to import it as a gradle project. To run the unit tests, right-click on the `tests` folder and you will be 
able to execute all the tests, optionally with test coverage by right-clicking on the test folder and selecting the 'Run All Tests with Coverage' option. One can also run the main application by right-clicking 
on the `Main` class.
