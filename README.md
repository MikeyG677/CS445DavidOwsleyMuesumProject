# Short Group Project for CS445 Spring 2019
Group members consist of Jaden Drury, Chris Wilson, Mike Gallegos, Robert Klueber.

Our main implementation goal is to allow users to to ...

This repository contains code for a running example in 
[the Spring 2019 section of CS445 Human-Computer Interaction](http://www.cs.bsu.edu/~pvgestwicki/courses/cs445Sp19/)
at [Ball State University](https://www.bsu.edu).

This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/). If you clone it into [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), 
you will be able to import it as a gradle project. 
You can run the main application by right-clicking on the Main class and selecting 'Run'. To run the unit tests, right-click on the `tests` folder and select 'Run All Tests'. To run the unit tests with test coverage, select 'Run All Tests with Coverage' in the same menu.


Report Self Assessment:

    [] D.1.R. The report is a Google Docs document within the class' Google Drive folder.
    [] D.2.R. The title of the project and its contributors are clearly identified at the top of the document.
    [] C.1.R. The document begins with an executive summary that provides an overview of the report's content.
    [] C.2.R. The document describes the problem that is being solved.
    [] C.3.R. The document describes the solution to the problem as conceived by the authors.
    [] C.4.R. The required self-assessment is an appendix to your project report unless it is instead included in the README.
    [] B.1.R. The document describes the process by which the problem was identified.
    [] B.2.R. The document describes the process by which the solution was designed, including relevant design artifacts such as personas and journey maps.
    [] B.3.R. The document explains how the following fundamental principles of interaction are manifest, or fail to manifest, in your solution: affordances, signifiers, cmappings, feedback, and conceptual models.
    [] B.4.R. A common use case for the solution is documented through a series of annotated screenshots.
    [] B.5.R. The document describes the methods by which the solution was evaluated.
    [] A.1.R. The documented solution evaluation includes both quantitative and qualitative elements that explicitly align with this semester's readings.
    [] A.2.R. Each of the aforementioned fundamental principles of interaction are explained with clearly annotated and described screenshots or figures.


Source Self Assessment:

    [] D.1.S. The project contains a README file in plain text, HTML, or Markdown in the root directory. This file lists the names of all project contributors and gives appropriate attribution for any third-party assets used in the project.
    [] D.2.S. The project compiles without errors.
    [] C.1.S. The project compiles without warnings. Any warning suppressions are clearly documented and justifiable, never excuses for bad design.
    [] C.2.S. The project executes without warnings or errors during expected usage.
    [] C.3.S. The project contains unit tests that document the expected behavior of at least part of the model layer.
    [] C.4.S. Instructions for running the unit tests are provided in the README file.
    [] C.5.S. The required self-assessment is included in the README unless it is a report appendix.
    [] C.6.S. Source code dependencies are automatically managed.
    [] B.1.S. Variables and methods are meaningfully named in accordance with the rules of Clean Code Chapter 2.
    [] B.2.S. You follow the naming conventions of your implementation language except where they contradict the previous criterion.
    [] B.3.S. Methods are short, singular in purpose, and low in arity, in compliance with Clean Code Chapter 3.
    [] B.4.S. Source code comments comply with the rules of Clean Code Chapter 4.
    [] B.5.S. Source code formatting complies with the rules of Clean Code Chapter 5.
    [] B.6.S. Classes are small and follow the Single Responsibility Principle, in accordance with Clean Code Chapter 10.
    [] B.7.S. All signifiers within the user-interface point to implemented features. That is, a user cannot access an incomplete feature.
    [] B.8.S. Unit tests document the correctness of the model layer, as evidenced in part by having at least 90% coverage.
    [] B.9.S. Instructions for running the unit tests and measuring coverage are provided in the README file.
    [] A.1.S. The separation between the persistence layer and the model layer is clearly identified through one or more interfaces.
    [] A.2.S. The separation between the UI layer and the model layer is clearly identified through one or more interfaces.
    [] A.3.S. Instructions on how to build and execute the application are provided in the README file.

With the given criteria, our project would recieve an [] based on our assessment.
